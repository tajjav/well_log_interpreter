# well_log_interpreter
basic well log interpreter

## An exemple of how to make a quick interpretation of well logs using python, matplotlib, pandas and a few pre-defined petrophysical functions. ﻿

Check the Jupyter notebook!

## Test data is in WA-1.las, which is converted in WA-1.txt with lastotext.py (not an elegant solution for reading las files!)
## Logs can be finally exported to csv or excel !
